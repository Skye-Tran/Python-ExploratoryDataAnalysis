# Python-ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis with pandas, missingno and seaborn

In this Jupyter Notebook, we will use a bank marketing campaign dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pandas, seaborn and missingno library.
The dataset can be downloaded from this URL https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/bank-marketing-campaigns-dataset 

The bank conducted marketing campaign mostly via phone calls to offer clients to place a term deposit. If the client agreed to place the deposit, the client is marked as 'yes' for subscribed to a term deposit. Otherwise, the client is marked as 'no'.

EDA will be the first step in our mini-project to predict whether a client will subscribe to the deposit based on details gathered from the marketing campaign.
